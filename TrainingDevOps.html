        <h2>Story of Mortal Kombat 11</h2>
        
        <p>
            In the brutal universe of Mortal Kombat, realms collide in a battle for ultimate supremacy. Mortal Kombat 11 picks up the narrative threads, weaving a tale of temporal chaos and unforgiving combat. Kronika, the Keeper of Time, seeks to reshape history, threatening to tear the fabric of reality itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            As warriors from past and present converge, alliances are forged and vendettas rekindled. The fate of entire realms rests upon the shoulders of Earthrealm's champions. They must stand united against the apocalyptic designs of Kronika and her fearsome enforcer, Geras, whose power over time itself makes him a formidable adversary.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mortal Kombat 11 is a high-stakes battle where heroes face not only their opponents, but the very threads of existence.
